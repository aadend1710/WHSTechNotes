As of right now, my feelings on this new phone policy are very mixed. I am adjusting to it well, but i still think that it is a bit of a weird move since it could cause safety problems (for example, what if there was an extreme emergency that not even the nurses at the school could take care of and they needed to be taken home? and due to that law, the student couldn't call home and might spread the sickness.) However, I have noticed that there are some upsides such as students paying way more attention in class under the threat of a law. I do have some concerns since they are PERSONAL belongings that only our parents should have the right to have or deal with and not the school, since it's not THEIR phone. But it's only fair since most of the students are still minors who cannot be trusted with responsibilties such as this.

I have multiple careers that I am very interested in such as film making and photography/videography and I believe that computer science and be used in both of these. The use of computer science is found in the development of cameras and software that are used to enhance and reproduce photos and videos. Additionally, it is used to create computer-generated imagery (CGI) for special effects, animation, and virtual sets through technologies like motion capture and rendering softwares. These applications prove that computer science is a powerful tool for visual artists. The ability to manipulate images, create digital content, and enhance effects through code allows creators to push the boundaries of what is possible in their work. This demonstrates the strong link and direct relationship between computer science and the visual arts, which makes computer science a valuable interest for film makers and photographers.

Working in a virtual store for real money, as exemplified by IKEA's venture on Roblox, is a promising and innovative development for the future of jobs. This initiative demonstrates how technology can create new employment opportunities and offer flexibility, particularly appealing to younger generations familiar with gaming and virtual environments. The ability to earn income in a virtual space, like the $16.10 per hour offered by IKEA, that can provide accessible work for individuals who might face barriers in traditional employment settings, or those seeking supplementary income. The IKEA example illustrates a practical application of the metaverse, where skills transferable from real-world retail (aka things like customer service and inventory management) which can be utilized in a virtual context. This opens doors for diverse talent pools, potentially including those with physical limitations or geographical constraints, and allows for a more dynamic and adaptable workforce. As technology advances, virtual work can offer increased autonomy and a broader range of roles, making it a valuable addition to the evolving job market.

The phrase "6, 7" is mostly meaningless, which is precisely the point. It likely originated from a viral TikTok sound from Skrilla's song "Doot Doot (6 7)." This sound has basically become a modern inside joke for students. When repeated, the phrase is often accompanied by an up-and-down hand motion. Some suggest the gesture refers to NBA player LaMelo Ball, but it mostly signifies shared humor. Its absurdity is the primary appeal, intentionally frustrating adults who don't understand it. By repeating the phrase, students affirm their place within a shared digital culture. It signifies a shared "brain rot" humor that intentionally lacks deeper meaning.

If I were in charge of my own school, my technology and AI policy would prioritize responsible student use rather than outright bans. Students would be permitted to use their own devices, but they would be held accountable for using them productively. A notable exception would be AI tools, the use of which would be strictly limited to prevent over-reliance and ensure students master fundamental skills first. To support learning, educational sites and games would remain fully accessible and encouraged for their benefits. This policy would include both Chromebooks and personal phones, recognizing that these devices can serve productive purposes in an educational environment. The aim is to create a better school culture where students feel less anxious about using their phones for essential communication with parents. Such an approach would help foster digital literacy and responsibility instead of fostering resentment toward restrictive rules. By balancing accessibility with accountability, the policy would create a more modern and trusting academic atmosphere.

My prompt was created to educate and help highschool students learn more about the coding world and tools like python in an effort to help high school students learn about coding with Python. The interactive approach, which used mini-website windows to showcase code, was a successful way to engage the students. Canva had interpreted it as a neat website with windows into mini sites that help the students practice and see codes. The interactive thing that worked best was the mini websites that helped show what python and other coding things look like in a mini window. However, the project's primary weakness was an over-reliance on examples rather than providing precise, factual definitions. To improve, the content needs more accurate explanations to properly educate the audience and incorporating more factual information will provide a stronger educational foundation for students interested in coding.

During and after a natural disaster, technology provides essential lifelines for communication, information, and rescue efforts. Before a natural disaster, tools like predictive modeling and early warning systems help people prepare for and evacuate from dangerous areas. During the event, people use smartphones to communicate with loved ones via social media, text messages, and mobile weather apps, sharing information and coordinating efforts when traditional communication methods fail. After a disaster, satellite technology assists first responders by providing crucial images for damage assessment and mapping search and rescue routes. These technologies empower individuals to make informed decisions for their own safety and the safety of others, transforming disaster response from a reactive, chaotic event into a more coordinated and effective effort. For example, during a wildfire, a mobile app could alert users to the fire's proximity and direction, while satellite data could be used to guide firefighters to the most critical areas. Ultimately, these tools empower communities to better withstand the devastation caused by natural disasters.

If I could invent a new piece of technology, it would be a network of small, automated drones powered by solar energy that could be deployed to disaster areas. These drones would be equipped with thermal cameras, GPS, and a robust, ad-hoc communication system. During a flood or earthquake, these drones would swarm over the affected area, surveying the damage in real-time, identifying trapped individuals using thermal imaging, and transmitting the location of survivors to emergency services via a self-contained communication network. For instance, after a severe hurricane causes widespread flooding, these drones could quickly locate people stranded on rooftops or in submerged cars, pinpointing their exact locations for rescue teams. This would significantly reduce the time it takes for help to arrive in hard-to-reach areas and could help save countless lives by providing first responders with real-time, actionable intelligence even when ground-based infrastructure is compromised.

A funding lapse for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a major problem because the program is the nation's most important anti-hunger initiative, and its disruption leaves millions of low-income families unable to afford food. Most affected are those relying on fixed incomes, low wages, or assistance for themselves and their children, with marginalized communities disproportionately impacted. Technology could help by creating a centralized app or website that connects people with local food resources like food banks and free meal programs. Potential tools could display locations and hours, provide directions, and offer real-time updates on inventory or services. However, challenges include the digital divide, where low-income individuals might lack consistent internet access, reliable smartphones, or the digital literacy to use these tools effectively. Privacy concerns could also prevent some users from providing personal information necessary to receive aid.

If I were the designer, my tool would be called "NourishNow," a mobile-first website designed for accessibility on any device, even with limited internet. NourishNow would use location services to immediately show nearby food pantries, free meal sites, and grocery stores offering special programs, with clear directions and hours. Instead of requiring user accounts, it would prioritize privacy and provide information instantly upon visiting the site. The platform would also include a community forum where users could share information about local food drives or temporary assistance programs. To address the digital divide, a call-in service would be available, connecting users to a human assistant who could provide the same information found online.

One job that heavily relies on drones is a Drone Software Engineer. These professionals design and implement the software and algorithms that allow Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to fly autonomously and execute complex tasks. Coding in languages like Python is essential for developing flight control systems, processing sensor data for navigation and obstacle avoidance, and integrating computer vision to analyze data collected for applications like mapping or inspections. In Texas, the average annual pay for a Drone Software Engineer is approximately $137,441 as of November. Education requirements typically include a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or a related field, often coupled with knowledge of robotics and a professional certification.

A self-driving car might fail to recognize a stopped school bus due to sensor limitations or AI perception errors. The car's cameras and Lidar/Radar sensors must accurately detect not just the yellow bus, but also the small, dynamic elements like the flashing red lights and the extended stop arm. The primary challenge is robust object and state detection in varied conditions: the cameras and LiDAR must reliably recognize the small, thin stop arm and rapidly flashing red lights in conditions like low sun, rain, or when the bus is partially occluded by other vehicles. Waymo's reported issue—where the car slowed but then proceeded—suggests a software rule error where the "stop for school bus" logic was prematurely overridden by an "obstacle clear" or "proceed with caution" rule. As a Waymo programmer, I would implement a two-level safety override: the first successful detection of the flashing red lights and extended stop arm must trigger a hard, non-negotiable emergency-stop logic that locks the vehicle's speed at zero and cannot be overridden until the sensors confirm the lights are off and the arm is fully retracted for a minimum time.

During the winter break, I relied on my laptop to research complex topics from different subjects, benefiting from the larger screen and more efficient processing power. I effectively used my phone to stay organized on the go, utilizing many of my mobile apps to review digital flashcards and track my grades to look for improvement. To bridge the two of my devices, I used cloud-based storage to sync my notes instantly, which ensures I could transition from a party at my house thrown by my parents to deep work on my electronics. This seamless integration of technology allowed me to maintain my academic momentum in preparation for the new year while still enjoying the flexibility and joy of the holiday season.
