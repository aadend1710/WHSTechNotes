Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

As of right now, my feelings on this new phone policy are very mixed. I am adjusting to it well, but i still think that it is a bit of a weird move since it could cause safety problems (for example, what if there was an extreme emergency that not even the nurses at the school could take care of and they needed to be taken home? and due to that law, the student couldn't call home and might spread the sickness.) However, I have noticed that there are some upsides such as students paying way more attention in class under the threat of a law. I do have some concerns since they are PERSONAL belongings that only our parents should have the right to have or deal with and not the school, since it's not THEIR phone. But it's only fair since most of the students are still minors who cannot be trusted with responsibilties such as this.

I have multiple careers that I am very interested in such as film making and photography/videography and I believe that computer science and be used in both of these. The use of computer science is found in the development of cameras and software that are used to enhance and reproduce photos and videos. Additionally, it is used to create computer-generated imagery (CGI) for special effects, animation, and virtual sets through technologies like motion capture and rendering softwares. These applications prove that computer science is a powerful tool for visual artists. The ability to manipulate images, create digital content, and enhance effects through code allows creators to push the boundaries of what is possible in their work. This demonstrates the strong link and direct relationship between computer science and the visual arts, which makes computer science a valuable interest for film makers and photographers.

Working in a virtual store for real money, as exemplified by IKEA's venture on Roblox, is a promising and innovative development for the future of jobs. This initiative demonstrates how technology can create new employment opportunities and offer flexibility, particularly appealing to younger generations familiar with gaming and virtual environments. The ability to earn income in a virtual space, like the $16.10 per hour offered by IKEA, that can provide accessible work for individuals who might face barriers in traditional employment settings, or those seeking supplementary income. The IKEA example illustrates a practical application of the metaverse, where skills transferable from real-world retail (aka things like customer service and inventory management) which can be utilized in a virtual context. This opens doors for diverse talent pools, potentially including those with physical limitations or geographical constraints, and allows for a more dynamic and adaptable workforce. As technology advances, virtual work can offer increased autonomy and a broader range of roles, making it a valuable addition to the evolving job market.

I mostly believe that the phrase "6, 7" is mostly meaningless, which is precisely the point. This is probably because it origininates from a viral TikTok sound from the song "Doot Doot (6 7)" by Skrilla, and has basically become a modern inside joke. Whenever the numbers are often repeated, the person makes an up-and-down hand motion, which could be referring to NBA player LaMelo Ball. Students use it as a silly, nonsensical response to any question, from a test grade to a question in the hallway. Its appeal lies in its absurdity and the frustration it causes adults and other students who don't understand. By repeating the phrase, students affirm their place within a shared digital culture. In a chaotic or apathetic tone, it signifies a shared "brain rot" humor that intentionally lacks deeper meaning
