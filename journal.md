Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

As of right now, my feelings on this new phone policy are very mixed. I am adjusting to it well, but i still think that it is a bit of a weird move since it could cause safety problems (for example, what if there was an extreme emergency that not even the nurses at the school could take care of and they needed to be taken home? and due to that law, the student couldn't call home and might spread the sickness.) However, I have noticed that there are some upsides such as students paying way more attention in class under the threat of a law. I do have some concerns since they are PERSONAL belongings that only our parents should have the right to have or deal with and not the school, since it's not THEIR phone. But it's only fair since most of the students are still minors who cannot be trusted with responsibilties such as this.
